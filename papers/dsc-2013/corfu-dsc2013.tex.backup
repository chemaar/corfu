\begin{abstract}
Public administrations are currently facing a big challenge trying to improve both the peformance and the transparency of administrative processes.
In this context the e-Government and Open Linked Data initiatives are tackling existing interoperability and 
integration issues among ICT-based systems but the creation of a real transparent environment requires 
much more than the simple publication of data and information in specific open formats; data and information 
quality is the next major step in the pubic sector. More specifically in the e-Procurement domain there is a 
vast amount of valuable data that is already available via the Internet protocols and formats and can be used 
for the creation of new added-value services. Neverthless the simple extraction of statistics or creation of reports 
can imply extra tasks with regards to clean, prepare and reconcile data. 
From a transparency point of view one of the most interesting services lies in tracking rewarded contracts (type and supplier). 
Depending on the capabilities of the public organization this kind of basic report can turn into a 
complex task due to a lack of standardization in supplier names or the use of different descriptors for the type of contract. That is why 
this paper presents a stepwise method based on natural language processing and semantics to deal with the hetereogenities in corporate names. 
Furthermore a research study to evaluate the precision and recall of the proposed technique using as use case the public dataset of rewarded public 
contracts in Australia during the period 2005-2012 is also presented, finally some discussion, conclusions and future work 
are also outlined.

% The aim of this paper is to present the application of a common model to describe the information about organizations in a standard way 
% using the Linked Data approach. Several models and ontologies have been provided in order 
% to formalize the data, structure and behavior of organizations. Nevertheless these tries have not 
% fully accepted due to some factors: 1) missing pieces to define the status of the organization; 
% 2) tangled parts to specify the structure (concepts and relations) between the elements of the organization; 
% 3) lack of text properties, etc. These divergences imply a set of incomplete approaches to formalize 
% data and information about organizations. Taking into account the current trends of applying 
% semantic web technologies and linked data to formalize, aggregate and share domain specific information, 
% a new model for organizations taking advantage of these initiatives is required in order to overcome existing barriers 
% and exploit the corporate information in a standard way. This proposal is especially relevant in 
% some senses to: 1) unify existing models to provide a common specification; 2) apply semantic web technologies and 
% the Linked Data approach to enrich and publish the relevant corporate information; 3) 
% provide access to the information via standard protocols and 4) offer new services that can exploit this 
% information to trace the evolution and behavior of the organization over time. Finally, 
% this work is interesting to improve the clarity and transparency of some scenarios in which 
% organizations play a key role like e-procurement, e-health or financial transactions.

\section{Introduction}
An organization is considered to be a set of constraints on the activities performed by agents.  
This approach was presented in~\cite{Weber1978} who viewed the process of bureaucratization as a shift 
from management. Previously, Mintzberg provided an analysis of organization structure 
distinguishing among five basic parts of an organization and five distinct organization configurations. 
This vision put together some mechanisms to achieve coordination with the objective of modeling goals, 
business processes and rules, authority, positions and communication. In this context, some works 
are emerged~\cite{Fox95anorganisation} trying to create ontologies and models that specify the realm of organizations but 
different problems are arisen due to some factors: 1) missing pieces to define the status of the organization; 
2) tangled parts to specify the structure (concepts and relations) between the elements of the organization; 
3) lack of text properties, 4) name mismatches, etc. 


Public bodies are continuously publishing procurement opportunities in which 
valuable metadata is available. Depending on the stage of the process new data 
arises such as the supplier name or the organization that has been rewarded with 
the public contract. In this context the extraction of statistics on how many 
contracts are rewarded to the same company and as a consequence the value of 
these contracts is a relevant indicator to evaluate the transparency of the 
public procurement process. Nevertheless the use of different naming techniques 
such as internal IDs or string literals implies that the task of grouping 
contracts by a supplier is not a mere process of searching by the same literal. 
In the particular case of Australia, the supplier name seems to be introduced by 
typing a string literal without any assistance or auto-complete method. 
Obviously a variety of errors can be found such as misspelling errors, same 
company under different names, use of different kind of acronyms [2,3], etc. As 
an example a company such as “Oracle”, “Accenture” or “Capgemini” can be found 
under different name conventions: “Oracle Aust.”, “Oracle University”, “Oracle 
Corpoartion (Aust) Pty Ltd”, “Oracle Corp Aust P/L”, “Accentrure”, “Accenture 
Australia”, “CAP Gemini” among others. Although a large company can be divided 
into several divisions or departments the truth is that to group statistics by 
supplier, a method to unify organization names simulating the human way of 
grouping names is required.


In the Semantic Web area and more specifically in the Linked (Open) Data 
initiative one of the principles lies in providing a real unique identification 
of resources through URIs. Thus reconciliation techniques [5,6,7] coming from 
the ontology mapping and alignment areas or algorithms based on Natural Language 
Processing have been designed to link similar resources already available in 
different vocabularies, datasets or databases such as DBPedia or Freebase. In 
the specific case of company names there is an open database, OpenCorporates, 
that has collected more than 52 million of names around the world and it can be 
considered a perfect candidate to perform the reconciliation process between a 
string literal and a resource in this database to obtain an unique identifier. 
Nevertheless the issue of unifying supplier names as a human would do faces new 
problems that have been tackled in other research works [1] to extract 
statistics of performance in bibliographic databases. The main objective is not 
just a mere reconciliation process to link to existing resource but to create a 
unique name or link. For instance in the case of the ongoing example “Oracle” 
could be mapped to the entitye Oracle and ``Oracle University'' to the entity ``Oracle_University'' but 
the problem of grouping by a unique (Big) name or resource still remains. That 
is why a context-aware method based on Natural Language Processing techniques 
has been designed, customized and implemented trying to exploit the naming 
convention of a specific dataset.


The technique to generate a unique name before performing the reconciliation 
process is a stepwise method, see 1, in which each step performs a filter over 
the string literal trying to remove all unnecessary words in the name to finally 
use an iterative process of string comparison and grouping to generate a unique 
and relevant name for the input dataset. This process has been implemented using 
the NLTK library and other external Python APIs such as fuzzywuzzy or a spell 
checker based on the well-known Peter Norvig speller. After this initial process 
of unifying names a second step to reconcile names can be easily done reusing 
resources in OpenCorporates, DBPedia, Linkedin Companies or Google Places. 
Although a naïve implementation is already available it is considered an 
extension and ongoing work that is out of the scope of this report.  




\section{Related Work}

In the case of organizations it is quite a hard search to do because a lot of ontologies need some notion of Organization to point to. E.g. FOAF is about people but needs to mention the ``Organizations'' 
of which a person is a member, Inference Web~\footnote{\url{http://inference-web.org/}} is about distributed 
inference but covers trust and provenance which in turn requires a notion of organizations 
(that are in a trust relationship). In each of these cases the representation of Organization is minimal. 
Following the evaluation made by Dave Reynolds (Epimorphics Ltd) in this web report\footnote{\url{http://www.epimorphics.com/web/wiki/organization-ontology-survey}}, several approaches can be found. 
Firstly, in previous works there are a number of similar upper ontologies (Proton, Sumo, SmartWeb) that include 
some notion of Organization. These models have a lot of other intentions that are not match with 
the specific requirement of a small and reusable model to describe organizations 
but they should be reviewed. Secondly, if search engines are used to look for the concept of 
Organization the next results will be found: Swoogle $3,990$ matches, Falcons gives $15,881$ hits for Organization concept 
from $15$ highlighted vocabularies and Google turns up: 1) the ``Organization Ontology 1.0'' written in SHOE, 
giving a basic hierarchy of organization, industries and employee roles; 2) an ``Organization Ontology for Enterprise Modelling'' 
which is focused on supply chain and 3) ``Enterprise Ontology'', an ontology to represent the activity of
 business enterprises expressed in Ontolingua. Jeni Tennison~\footnote{\url{http://www.jenitennison.com/}} has also pointed 
to an ontology developed by TSO for the London Gazette RDFa markup: Gazette Organization and Gazette Person. 
According to the authors of this survey the following approaches should be reviewed: AKT Portal Ontology,
Proton top, Good Relations, FOAF, SIOC, Enterprise Modelling Ontology, Enterprise Ontology, Gazette organization and 
person ontologies, Provenance Vocabulary Core Ontology, and other like School of ECS (University of Southampton) or 
Academic Institution Internal Structure Ontology (AIISO), vocabularies for describing the internal organizational 
structure of an academic institution. This situation implies a tangled environment for describing organizations and supposes
a barrier to promote this information to the new Web of Data.


In Figure~\ref{figure:open}, an example of an organization (in N3 format) using ``The Open Database Of The Corporate World''~\footnote{\url{http://opencorporates.com/}}, 
Open Corporates, is presented. This information is potentially relevant to this work due to the large database 
that Open Corporates provides ($54,080,317$ of companies in May 2012) with high-valuable information like the company ID. 
These data follow a mixed approach between Open and the LOD approach but a formal model describing the organizations is missing. 
That is why the use of a common ontology could improve the information sharing and the exploitation of the information in a standard way generating new value-added services 
of five starslike activity tracking.

\subsection{Entity Reconciliation}

This process can be briefly defined as the method for looking and mapping two 
different concepts or entities under a certain threshold. There are a lot of 
works presenting solutions about concept mapping, entity reconciliation, etc. 
most of them are focused on natural language processing (if two concepts have 
similar descriptions then they should be similar) and others (ontology-based) 
that also exploit the semantic information (hierarchy, number and type of 
relations) to establish a potential mapping (if two concepts share similar 
properties and similar super classes then these concepts should be similar). 
Apart from that there are also machine learning techniques to deal with these 
mismatches in descriptions using statistical approaches.
In recent times, this situation has been widely studied and applied to the field 
of linking entities in the Linked Open Data realm. Although there is no way of 
creating a mapping with a 100\% of confidence (without human validation) a 
mapping with a certain percentage can be enough (in the case of using these 
techniques as previous step of a reasoning process this situation should be 
carefully managed to avoid the inference of incorrect facts).


\section{Mismatches in Corporate Names}

\subsection{Modeling Organizational Structures}
The broad objective of modeling organizational structures is to promote this information using semantic technologies and the LOD approach. To get this objective 
the Organizations Ontology~\footnote{\url{http://www.epimorphics.com/public/vocabulary/org.html}} represents a first step to model organizations but 
some issues should be addressed to spread the scope of this specification: 1) Structure; 2) Human resources; 3) Corporate image; 4) Id; 5) Name; 
6) Purposes and intentions; 7) Cataloging products, services and activities; 8) Multilingual and multicultural problems; 9) Inter/Intra relationships or 
10) Activity Tracking and Financial transactions (e.g XBRL could be used). Nevertheless we have used this ontology to initially address the objectives of this work because 
it is core ontology for organizational structures (see Fig\footnote{Source: http://www.epimorphics.com/public/vocabulary/diagram.png}.~\ref{fig:org}), 
aimed at supporting linked-data publishing of organizational information across a number of domains. It is also designed 
to allow domain-specific extensions to add classification of organizations and roles, 
as well as extensions to support neighboring information such as organizational activities. 
This ontology partially fits to the aim of modeling organizations in a standard and reusable way 
with semantic technologies. 


\section{The CORFU approach}

\section{Experimentation and Evaluation}

In order to validate the approach outlined in this summary the dataset of 
supplier names in Australia in the period 2005-2012 containing 430188 full names 
and 77526 unique names has been selected. Initially the traditional 
reconciliation process using Google Refine and OpenCorporates generated an 8\% of 
links but most of them were incorrect or not grouped by the same resource. After 
applying the above-mentioned stepwise method the initial set 77526 names were 
grouped in 40278 distinct names (51\% of potential right links to OpenCoporates). 
Furthermore these unified names were reviewed by hand and in the specific case 
of the first one hundred companies in the Forbes list a 100\% of correct names 
can be now ensured.
The main conclusion of this works lies in the design of a technique to prepare 
raw organization names in a specific context, e.g. Australia supplier names, 
before performing a reconciliation process. Although the percentage of potential 
right links to existing datasets has been dramatically improved it is clear that 
human-validation is also required to ensure the correct unification of names. 
Other NLP techniques based on n-grams or a classifier will be used in the future 
to deliver a complete and intelligent company unifier. On the other hand, the 
application of this technique enables the comparison of rewarded contracts to 
different companies and can help to improve the transparency in public 
administrations.

% 
% In the scope of LOD and open government data (OGD) there are projects

% from different sectors: transport, defense, NUTS geographical
% information~\footnote{\url{http://nuts.psi.enakting.org/}}, etc. Most of the
% public administrations in the different countries are also betting for LOD
% approach to make public their information: Spain (Aporta
% project~\footnote{\url{http://www.aporta.es/}}),
% USA\footnote{\url{http://www.data.gov/}}, etc. On the other hand, Product Scheme Classifications (also known as PSCs) 
% like the CPV (Common Procurement Vocabulary available at RAMON, the Eurostat's metadata server) have been built to solve
% specific problems of interoperability and communication in e-commerce\cite{Volker02amodeling,Corcho01solvingintegration}. 
% The aim of a PSC is to be used as a standard \textit{de facto} by different agents for information interchange 
% in marketplaces~\cite{DBLP:journals/tcci/Alor-HernandezAJPRMBG10}. Any PSC, as well as other classification systems can 
% be interpreted as: 1) domain-ontologies~\cite{Hepp-possible} or 2) conceptual schemes~\cite{chemaEurovoc2008} comprised 
% of conceptual resources . Finally, Good Relations is an ontology for the e-commerce developed by 
% Martin Hepp et. al and now integrated the Yahoo Real Estate portal via RDFa.
% 
% In the field of the semantic web technologies and for modeling the domain knowledge 
% there are several options: RDF, RDF(S), OWL 2 or SKOS among others. 
% They provide a common format and data model for sharing and linking knowledge organization systems 
% via the web. This information can be retrieved using SPARQL, 
% a query language and a protocol to retrieve the information of datasets published via an endpoint. 
% Currently, there is a working group defining a vocabulary and a set of instructions

% 
% In order to accomplish with the contributions of this work we should define:
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item the process of extracting (and structuring) the public information available about organizations. In this case, we have developed
% a system\footnote{We have discarded the use of Google Refine and similar tools due to the huge amount of data to be processed.} 
% that takes the organizations~\footnote{\url{ftp://ftp.ted.europa.eu/META-XML/}} in CSV format available at TED 
%  ($\sim$ 320K) and transforms this information (ID, address, contact person and CPV codes or purposes inferred by the previous public 
% contracts awarded) to RDF according to the Organizations Ontology, the principles of LOD~\cite{heath11linked} paying special 
% attention to the URL design and SKOS to deal with multilingual issues. After that all generated triples are stored 
% in the triple store OpenLink Virtuoso~\footnote{\url{http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/}} (providing a SPARQL endpoint). 
% \item the access to the published information via Pubby. This linked data frontend is used to access generated triples but we have also developed a gateway that translates, on demand, the data of an ``OpenCorporates
% Organization'' (see Sect.\ref{open-corporates}) to our system unifying the access to the information through Pubby without replication of information.
% \item the exploitation of this information. Currently it is mainly made by two services: 1) an enhanced matchmaking service to search public procurement notices and
% 2) a simple organization activity track service in the e-procurement sector.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% \section{Use Case: Matchmaking and Tracking Organizations in the E-procurement sector}
% In the e-Procurement information domain, one of the targeted services~\cite{metteg2011} to be improved is the 
% ``search of public procurement notices according to a profile''. In the context of searching, 
% matchmaking refers to the procedure of retrieving a relevant list of results that matches with the 
% intentions of an organization that wants to tender in a specific activity sector. Other interesting service 
% on e-Procurement is the extraction of statistics to generate reports about the history of 
% some place, organization or contracting authority that can be exploited through temporal series, 
% weighted aggregation operators or statistical inference, specifically predictive inference. 
% 
% Let be $E$ an organization that wants to tender in a public procurement process,

% The relevance of this example lies on the demonstration that the information about organizations
% is a key-factor to provide enhanced services in different domains. In this case the e-procurement
% sector has been selected due to the ongoing research of the \#SKIP\# project. A public demo is also available
% at \#SKIP\#~\footnote{\url{\#SKIP\#}} and the data can be easily retrieved querying the SPARQL endpoint of
% the organizations dataset. Further implementations are supposed to exploit this data in order to provide more advanced
% statistics service, identify organizations across the web (resolving name mismatches) and to track corporate
% activities in different sectors.
% \section{Conclusions and Future Work}
% Now the information about organizations is considered to be a key factor for the transparency 
% and the improvement of corporate image of companies. In that sense public administrations are 
% very interested in the publication of their data following the LOD approach (e.g. using RDFa) and the Organizations Ontology 
% (it was original motivated by a need to publish information relating to government organizational 
% structure as part of the data.gov.uk initiative) is a first step to reach this broad objective. That is why a 
% specification to model organizations can change the current approach to discover, activity track and search organizations 
% in a specific domain. For instance in the e-Procurement sector an organization can be tracked 
% making possible the extraction of statistics about their public contracts (type, region, etc.). 
% In this document a review of existing ontologies for organizations is presented and an application of the Organizations Ontology 
% is also outlined to make the profile of an organization that wants to tender in the e-procurement sector.
%  This document is considered to be the first step to work in a common specification for modeling and exploiting
% information about organizations in the new realm of Linked Data. Regarding the future work, the results of this study are intended to be
% exploited by a commercial service like Eurolert.net~\cite{web20} and we are also interested in reporting the 
% results to \textit{The Internal Market and Services Directorate General (DG MARKT) of the European Commision},  
% \textit{The Information Society and Media Directorate General (DG INFSO) of the European Commision}, 
% the LOD and OGD initiatives among others.
